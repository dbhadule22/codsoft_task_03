Guess the Number in C++
This repository contains a simple "Guess the Number" game implemented in C++ as part of a GitHub internship program. The game randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player is prompted to guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number. To run the project locally, first clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/username/guess-the-number.git, and navigate to the project directory with cd guess-the-number. Compile the program using g++ guess_number.cpp -o guess_number, which will generate an executable named guess_number. Run the executable using ./guess_number, and follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. The program is a straightforward example of using basic loops, conditionals, and random number generation in C++. Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository, create a new branch for your changes, and submit a pull request.
